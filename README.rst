HolyView
========

Presentation
------------
Holyview is a tool designed to help you determine the most productive
thing to work on right now. It is based on the approach suggested by Stephen
Covey of classifying tasks by importance and urgency and to focus on important
and non-urgent stuff.

More details here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Things_First_(book)

To see your takslist as a grid (like this
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MerrillCoveyMatrix.png) press the G key.

Usage example
-------------
Create severals items (using "a"). Change their importance/urgence using
"i"/"I" and "u"/"U". Press G to switch to grid view. Choose what to do. Do it. Save
the world.

You worked on a task ? Just press + to increment its progression. The date when
you incremented is recorded. This way, progression plots can be
done.

Installation
------------
As root:
python setup.py install

Licence
-------
HolyView is under gplv3+
