HolyView
========

Presentation
------------
Holyview is a tool design to help you choose what could be the most efficient
thing to work on right now. It is based on the approach suggest by Stephen
Covey of classifying things by importance and urgency and to focus on important
and non-urgent stuff.

More details here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Things_First_(book)

To see your items in a grid (like that
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MerrillCoveyMatrix.png) press the key G.

Usage example
-------------
Create severals items (using "a"). Change their importances/urgences using
"i"/"I" and "u"/"U". Press G to enter grid mode. Choose what to do. Do it. Save
the world.

You have worked on a task ? Just press + to add a point to it. The date of when
you've had a point is recorded. This way, graphiques of activities will be
possible.

Installation
------------
In root:
python setup.py install

Licence
-------
HolyView is under gplv3+
